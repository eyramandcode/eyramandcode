### At a glance
#### What I'm working on right now
DataTalks 2025 MLOps Zoomcamp - coursework on MLOPs tools culminating in final end-to-end project

#### What I'm learning right now
1) How to incorporate MLFlow scripts into CI/CD - adding MLFlow to CCDS templates would have made a clean and naturally iterative framework for past ML projects if I had known!
2) Orchestration in the context of MLOps vs DE (past experience)
3) How to essay write for an audience ( ~~sprint~~ marathon)

#### What I just learned
1) How to automate adding + changing aliases to your registered ML models on MLFlow
2) You don't really need to use the word "really" in writing.

I'm a data professional with a background in engineering and experience in research. I recieved my B.S. in Chemical Engineering and minor in Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh in 2021. My work experience has been as a coder on non-coding R&D teams, so I've enjoyed translating technical concepts into accessible understanding and creating tools with purpose in the lab. For a change, I'm ready to be on a team with technical mentorship and a growth mindset so I can learn in a group environment.

#### Technical Skills
- **Languages & Tools**: Python, SQL, Java, C++
- **Data Science + Machine Learning**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow
- **Platforms**: AWS (SAA certification in progress)
- **Domain Knowledge**: Chemical processes, materials characterization, experimental design, catalysis, coatings formulation + more
